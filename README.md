# CloneDSlackTestimonial
I like the way slack does its testimonial

## Motivation:
Yesterday evening I was looking at the Slack landing pages and a certain feature that they use for their testimonials caught my attention.
I challenged myself to reproduce it. And this is what I got by the morning (took me about 2 hours). Ofcourse it's still imperfect. You may pick up the challenge by making this perfect.

## How to use

Download the example [or clone the repo](https://github.com/jermsam/CloneDSlackTestimonial.git):

```
git clone https://github.com/jermsam/CloneDSlackTestimonial.git yourcustomname
```

Move into directory and install dependencies using yarn:

```
cd yourcustomname && yarn
```
Check it out:

```
yarn dev
```
And build your awesome App upon it
